# IOT-MESH-ENABLED-ENVIRONMENTAL-MONITORING-SYSTEM
This project focuses on making a device that can effectively measure quality of air and pollutant level as well as noise pollution and send that data to the
reciever.this is a cost effective project for college students. This device is also capable of creating a local mesh network either with Bluetooth/WiFi or by
Device Cloud, which enables us to accurately monitor environmental pollution.
